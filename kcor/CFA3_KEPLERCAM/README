The zero points are determined as follows.
CfA3 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/700/1/331) was calibrated to Landolt (1992) secondary standards
for the Keplercam UBV bandpasses and to the Smith et al. (2002) secondary standards for the r'i' bandpasses.
The color transformation equations are in Table 2, reproduced here for convenience.

Detector/Filters    Color Term  Value   Night
Keplercam/UBVr'i'   (u − b)/(U − B) 1.0279 ± 0.0069 20
Keplercam/UBVr'i'   (b − v)/(B − V) 0.9212 ± 0.0029 37
Keplercam/UBVr'i'   (v − V)/(B − V) 0.0185 ± 0.0023 37
Keplercam/UBVr'i'   (v − r)/(V − r')    1.0508 ± 0.0029 37
Keplercam/UBVr'i'   (v − i)/(V − i')    1.0185 ± 0.0020 37

Lower-case filters correspond to the natural bandpasses and upper-case to the catalog values.
The catalog values for BD+17 4708 come from Landolt & Uomoto 2007 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/510485)
  V = 9.464 +/- 0.0026
B-V = 0.443 +/- 0.0015
U-B = 0.183 +/- 0.0021
and from Smith et al. 2002 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/339311)
   r' = 9.350 +/- 0.001
r'-i' = 0.100 +/- 0.001

Using these color transformations and assuming the errors are independent,
the natural magnitude (m_nat) in each bandpass is
U =  9.69218 +/- 0.00420
B =  9.88029 +/- 0.00337
V =  9.47220 +/- 0.00279
r =  9.35240 +/- 0.00406
i =  9.25424 +/- 0.00413

The synthetic fluxes and magnitudes are calculated in SNANA using:
wl = the uniformly sampled wavelengths of Hsiao07.dat's Ia model
dwl = the 10 A spacing of wl
flux_lam = CALSPEC's bd_17d4708_stisnic_007.fits linearly interpolated to match wl
trans = bandpass transmission functions similarly linearly interpolated
c = 2.99792458e18 A / s
h = 6.62607015e-27 erg s
F_AB = 3631 Jy = 3.631e-20 erg / s / cm^2 / Hz
Note: This makes 2.5log10(F_AB) -48.6 + 6.56e-5

The photon fluxes (photon_flux) in Nph/s/cm^2 are given by
1/(c*h) * sum(trans * flux_lam * wl**3 * dwl / (wl**2 - 0.25 * dwl**2))
in the limit of small dwl, this converges to
1/(c*h) * int(trans * flux_lam * wl * dwl)

The photon fluxes in each bandpass is
B = 120.884
V = 133.923
r = 198.950
i = 185.366

The synthetic magnitudes (m_syn) are given by
m_syn = 2.5*log10(F_AB) - 2.5*log10(photon_flux / weight)
where
weight = 1/h * sum(trans * wl * dwl / (wl**2 - 0.25*dwl**2))
in the limit of small dwl, this converges to
1/h * int(trans * dwl / wl)

The synthetic magnitude in each bandpass is
B = 9.7922
V = 9.4629
r = 9.3491
i = 9.2614

Finally, SNANA calculates a final offset term as m_nat - m_syn
The offset term for each bandpass is
B =  0.0881
V =  0.0093
r =  0.0033
i = -0.0072
Note: Using -48.6 instead of 2.5log10(F_AB) causes all offsets to round 0.0001 higher.
For consistency, the offsets use the F_AB term rather than the exact -48.6 term.
