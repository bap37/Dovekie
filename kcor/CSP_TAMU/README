The zero points are determined as follows.
CSP-I DR3 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aa8df0) was calibrated to Landolt (1992)
and Smith et al. (2002) secondary standards in the optical, and Persson et al. (1998) secondary standards in the NIR.
The color transformation equations are eqns 9-14 (inclusive) with color coefficients from Table 4.
The Swope+SITE3 {uBgVri}_nat natural magnitudes are related to the catalog values as follows:

u_nat = u' - (0.046 ± 0.017)*(u' - g')
g_nat = g' + (0.014 ± 0.011)*(g' - r')
r_nat = r' + (0.016 ± 0.015)*(r' - i')
i_nat = i' + (0.002 ± 0.015)*(r' - i')
B_nat = B  - (0.061 ± 0.012)*(B  - V )
V_nat = V  + (0.058 ± 0.011)*(V  - i')

The catalog values for BD+17 4708 come from Landolt & Uomoto 2007 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/510485)
  V = 9.464 +/- 0.0026
B-V = 0.443 +/- 0.0015
and from Smith et al. 2002 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/339311)
   r' = 9.350 +/- 0.001
u'-g' = 0.920 +/- 0.001
g'-r' = 0.290 +/- 0.001
r'-i' = 0.100 +/- 0.001

Using these color transformations and assuming the errors are independent,
the natural magnitude (m_nat) in each bandpass is
u = 10.51768 +/- 0.01574
B =  9.87998 +/- 0.00611
g =  9.64406 +/- 0.00349
V =  9.47641 +/- 0.00351
r =  9.35160 +/- 0.00180
i =  9.25020 +/- 0.00206
which is consistent with the listed BD+17 natural magnitudes on the CSP site
(u=10.518, g=9.644, r=9.352, i=9.250)

The synthetic fluxes and magnitudes are calculated in SNANA using:
wl = the uniformly sampled wavelengths of Hsiao07.dat's Ia model
dwl = the 10 A spacing of wl
flux_lam = CALSPEC's bd_17d4708_stisnic_007.fits linearly interpolated to match wl
trans = bandpass transmission functions similarly linearly interpolated
c = 2.99792458e18 A / s
h = 6.62607015e-27 erg s
F_AB = 3631 Jy = 3.631e-20 erg / s / cm^2 / Hz
Note: This makes 2.5log10(F_AB) -48.6 + 6.56e-5

The following numbers depend on the transmission function, so multiple sets are provided.
V corresponds to V_LC9844, V1 to V_LC3009, and V2 to V_LC3014

The photon fluxes (photon_flux) in Nph/s/cm^2 are given by
1/(c*h) * sum(trans * flux_lam * wl**3 * dwl / (wl**2 - 0.25 * dwl**2))
in the limit of small dwl, this converges to
1/(c*h) * int(trans * flux_lam * wl * dwl)

For the *.dat files
The photon fluxes in each bandpass is
u  =   9.88652
g  = 154.572
r  = 165.872
i  = 153.427
B  =  60.0312
V  =  95.9508
V1 =  92.5007
V2 =  95.8974
for the *.dat_mod files
u  =   9.96370
g  = 153.427
r  = 165.373
i  = 130.127
B  =  59.8529
V  =  95.7159
V1 =  91.7448
V2 =  95.7436
for the *.dat_mod_inv files
u  =   9.83023
g  = 156.991
r  = 167.041
i  = 130.746
B  =  60.5603
V  =  96.4887
V1 =  93.5864
V2 =  96.4092


The synthetic magnitudes (m_syn) are given by
m_syn = 2.5*log10(F_AB) - 2.5*log10(photon_flux / weight)
where
weight = 1/h * sum(trans * wl * dwl / (wl**2 - 0.25*dwl**2))
in the limit of small dwl, this converges to
1/h * int(trans * dwl / wl)

For the *.dat files
The synthetic magnitude in each bandpass is
u  = 10.4387
g  =  9.6194
r  =  9.3481
i  =  9.6320
B  =  9.7571
V  =  9.4638
V1 =  9.4586
V2 =  9.4664
for the *.dat_mod files
u  = 10.4477
g  =  9.6320
r  =  9.3505
i  =  9.2617
B  =  9.7703
V  =  9.4670
V1 =  9.4621
V2 =  9.4703
for the *.dat_mod_inv files
u  = 10.4298
g  =  9.6073
r  =  9.3458
i  =  9.2605
B  =  9.7442
V  =  9.4606
V1 =  9.4550
V2 =  9.4625

Finally, SNANA calculates a final offset term as m_nat - m_syn
For the *.dat files
The offset term for each bandpass is
u  =  0.0790
g  =  0.0247
r  =  0.0035
i  = -0.3818
B  =  0.1229
V  =  0.0126
V1 =  0.0179
V2 =  0.0100
for the *.dat_mod files
u  =  0.0700
g  =  0.0121
r  =  0.0011
i  = -0.0115
B  =  0.1097
V  =  0.0094
V1 =  0.0144
V2 =  0.0061
for the *.dat_mod_inv files
u  =  0.0879
g  =  0.0368
r  =  0.0058
i  = -0.0103
B  =  0.1358
V  =  0.0158
V1 =  0.0214
V2 =  0.0139

Note: Using -48.6 instead of 2.5log10(F_AB) probably causes some offsets to round 0.0001 higher.
For consistency, the offsets use the F_AB term rather than the exact -48.6 term.
