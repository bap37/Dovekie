The zero points are determined as follows.
CfA3 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/700/1/331) was calibrated to Landolt (1992) secondary standards
for the 4Shooter UBVRI bandpasses.
The color transformation equations are in Table 2, reproduced here for convenience.

Detector/Filters    Color Term  Value   Night
4Shooter/UBVRI  (u − b)/(U − B) 0.9912 ± 0.0078 16
4Shooter/UBVRI  (b − v)/(B − V) 0.8928 ± 0.0019 16
4Shooter/UBVRI  (v − V)/(B − V) 0.0336 ± 0.0020 16
4Shooter/UBVRI  (v − r)/(V − R) 1.0855 ± 0.0058 16
4Shooter/UBVRI  (v − i)/(V − I) 1.0166 ± 0.0067 16

Lower-case filters correspond to the natural bandpasses and upper-case to the catalog values.
The catalog values for BD+17 4708 come from Landolt & Uomoto 2007 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/510485)
  V = 9.464 +/- 0.0026
B-V = 0.443 +/- 0.0015
U-B = 0.183 +/- 0.0021
V-R = 0.298 +/- 0.0011
R-I = 0.320 +/- 0.0009
V-I = 0.618 +/- 0.0013

Using these color transformations and assuming the errors are independent,
the natural magnitude (m_nat) in each bandpass is
U = 9.69301 +/- 0.00405
B = 9.87440 +/- 0.00317
V = 9.47888 +/- 0.00275
R = 9.15541 +/- 0.00346
I = 8.85063 +/- 0.00514

The synthetic fluxes and magnitudes are calculated in SNANA using:
wl = the uniformly sampled wavelengths of Hsiao07.dat's Ia model
dwl = the 10 A spacing of wl
flux_lam = CALSPEC's bd_17d4708_stisnic_007.fits linearly interpolated to match wl
trans = bandpass transmission functions similarly linearly interpolated
c = 2.99792458e18 A / s
h = 6.62607015e-27 erg s
F_AB = 3631 Jy = 3.631e-20 erg / s / cm^2 / Hz
Note: This makes 2.5log10(F_AB) -48.6 + 6.56e-5

The photon fluxes (photon_flux) in Nph/s/cm^2 are given by
1/(c*h) * sum(trans * flux_lam * wl**3 * dwl / (wl**2 - 0.25 * dwl**2))
in the limit of small dwl, this converges to
1/(c*h) * int(trans * flux_lam * wl * dwl)

The photon fluxes in each bandpass is
U =  64.1594
B = 120.167
V = 136.119
R = 207.186
I = 173.811

The synthetic magnitudes (m_syn) are given by
m_syn = 2.5*log10(F_AB) - 2.5*log10(photon_flux / weight)
where
weight = 1/h * sum(trans * wl * dwl / (wl**2 - 0.25*dwl**2))
in the limit of small dwl, this converges to
1/h * int(trans * dwl / wl)

The synthetic magnitude in each bandpass is
U = 10.4413
B = 9.79061
V = 9.46123
R = 9.32622
I = 9.25511

Finally, SNANA calculates a final offset term as m_nat - m_syn
The offset term for each bandpass is
U = -0.7483
B = 0.0838
V = 0.0177
R = -0.1708
I = -0.4045
Note: Using -48.6 instead of 2.5log10(F_AB) causes all offsets to round 0.0001 higher except for the V offset.
For consistency, the offsets use the F_AB term rather than the exact -48.6 term.
