The zero points are determined as follows.
CfA3 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/700/1/331) was calibrated to Landolt (1992) secondary standards
for the 4Shooter UBVRI bandpasses.
The color transformation equations are in Table 2, reproduced here for convenience.

Detector/Filters    Color Term  Value   Night
U − B/both periods (u − b)/(U − B) 0.9981 ± 0.0209 17
B − V /period two (b − v)/(B − V ) 0.8734 ± 0.0024 25
V /both periods (v − V )/(B − V ) 0.0233 ± 0.0018 63
V − r′/period two (v − r)/(V − r ′) 1.0265 ± 0.0033 25
V − i′/both periods (v − i)/(V − i ′) 1.0239 ± 0.0016 63

Lower-case filters correspond to the natural bandpasses and upper-case to the catalog values.
The catalog values for BD+17 4708 come from Landolt & Uomoto 2007 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/510485)
  V = 9.464 +/- 0.0026
B-V = 0.443 +/- 0.0015
U-B = 0.183 +/- 0.0021
V-R = 0.298 +/- 0.0011
and from Smith et al. 2002 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/339311)
   r' = 9.350 +/- 0.001
r'-i' = 0.100 +/- 0.001

Using these color transformations and assuming the errors are independent,
the natural magnitude (m_nat) in each bandpass is
U = 9.67859 +/- 0.00541
B = 9.86124 +/- 0.00320
V = 9.47432 +/- 0.00272
r = 9.35730 +/- 0.00396
i = 9.25521 +/- 0.00409

The synthetic fluxes and magnitudes are calculated in SNANA using:
wl = the uniformly sampled wavelengths of Hsiao07.dat's Ia model
dwl = the 10 A spacing of wl
flux_lam = CALSPEC's bd_17d4708_stisnic_007.fits linearly interpolated to match wl
trans = bandpass transmission functions similarly linearly interpolated
c = 2.99792458e18 A / s
h = 6.62607015e-27 erg s
F_AB = 3631 Jy = 3.631e-20 erg / s / cm^2 / Hz
Note: This makes 2.5log10(F_AB) -48.6 + 6.56e-5

The following numbers depend on the transmission function, so multiple sets are provided.

The photon fluxes (photon_flux) in Nph/s/cm^2 are given by
1/(c*h) * sum(trans * flux_lam * wl**3 * dwl / (wl**2 - 0.25 * dwl**2))
in the limit of small dwl, this converges to
1/(c*h) * int(trans * flux_lam * wl * dwl)

For cfa4_U_p1.dat and the cfa4_{BVri}_p1_modtran.dat files
The photon fluxes in each bandpass is
U =  64.1594
B = 109.439
V = 140.489
R = 200.948
I = 167.590
and for the cfa4_{BVri}_p1_modtran.dat_weighted files
B =  91.2989
V = 175.559
R = 201.153
I = 166.166

The synthetic magnitudes (m_syn) are given by
m_syn = 2.5*log10(F_AB) - 2.5*log10(photon_flux / weight)
where
weight = 1/h * sum(trans * wl * dwl / (wl**2 - 0.25*dwl**2))
in the limit of small dwl, this converges to
1/h * int(trans * dwl / wl)

For cfa4_U_p1.dat and the cfa4_{BVri}_p1_modtran.dat files
The synthetic magnitude in each bandpass is
U = 10.4413
B =  9.7044
V =  9.4560
R =  9.3473
I =  9.2617
and for the cfa4_{BVri}_p1_modtran.dat_weighted files
B = 9.6959
V = 9.4520
r = 9.3444
i = 9.2611

Finally, SNANA calculates a final offset term as m_nat - m_syn
For cfa4_U_p1.dat and the cfa4_{BVri}_p1_modtran.dat files
The offset term for each bandpass is
U = -0.7627
B =  0.1569
V =  0.0183
R =  0.0100
I = -0.0065
and for the cfa4_{BVri}_p1_modtran.dat_weighted files
B =  0.1654
V =  0.0223
R =  0.0129
I = -0.0058

Note: Using -48.6 instead of 2.5log10(F_AB) causes all offsets to round 0.0001 higher except for the V offsets
for the normal and weighted versions, and the i offset of the weighted version.
For consistency, the offsets use the F_AB term rather than the exact -48.6 term.
