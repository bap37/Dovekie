The 4shooter (UBVRI Harris filter passbands for CfA3) are given
in the *last* column of the file attached: cfa2.passbands.dat
There was no change between the last CfA2 objects (Jha et al. 2006)
to the first CfA3 objects.
Note that these are ENERGY units, so divide the sensitivity by lambda.

The Keplercam (UBVri) bandpasses are at
http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/supernova/CfA3/keplercam.passbands.txt
There is no U response, so we probably have to stick with the U
response from the file above.

We don't have the Minicam filter responses, so probably we should use
the Keplercam ones or toss those 5 light curves.

The Jha06 transmission functions can be downloaded from
https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/ftp/J/AJ/131/527/table5.dat
These are in the file table5.dat
The columns are described in the paper and the README
https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/ftp/J/AJ/131/527/ReadMe
They are reproduced here for convenience.

If table5.dat, keplercam.passbands.txt, and modtran_atm_stubbs_Jan21.dat exist,
running create_bandpasses.py will create files for the 4Shooter and Keplercam bandpasses
named 4sh_{UBVRI}_modtran.dat and KC_{BVri}_modtran.dat respectively. The files have
unlabeled columns of wavelength in Angstroms and photonic transmission (max 1).
All bandpasses have one application of the model atmosphere (1 airmass?), except
4Shooter's U band, which has one airmass of the "IRAF Kitt Peak atmospheric extinction curve,
adjusted to match the average observed extinction coefficients" (sec 2.4, Jha et al., 2006).
The model atmosphere is interpolated to the bandpass wavelengths via a spline.
