Here are preliminary passbands from Claire.  The Vri are stable across the
bakeout but the B changes.  The Oct2010 B corresponds to period 2 in the
CfA4 photometry and June 2012 B (after the bakeout which more or less
returned the B passband to the period conditions) to period 1.  You can use
either V date since they're basically the same.

Let me know if you have questions.

Cheers,
Malcolm

Hi Armin,

CfA4 photometry and June 2012 B (after the bakeout which more or less

20250226 Aaron Do:
The rfunction.txt, ifunction.txt, VH_smooth_June.dat, and BHOct2010.txt files are not here,
but the names exactly match the file names in SNooPy's repository.
For provenance, I'm including them here (along with BHJune2011), although it looks like the
SNooPy files may have been modified. They are already in Angstroms and the numbers don't
exactly match the cfa4_{B_p2,V,r,i}.dat files that were presumably created by Dan's IDL code.
